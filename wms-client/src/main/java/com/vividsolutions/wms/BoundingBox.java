/**
 * Represents a bounding box in a specific projection.
 * A BoundingBox is immutable, so you must create a new BoundingBox object,
 * rather than modify the the values of an existing BoundingBox.
 * WARNING : until WMS 3.1, xmin, ymin represent minimum longitude and
 * minimum latitude. From WMS 1.3.0, xmin represents min value for the first
 * axis of the CoordinateSystem and ymin the min value for the second axis.
 * This means that for EPSG:4326, we have
 * WMS 1.1.x : -180, -90, +180, +90
 * WMS 1.3.0 : -90, -180, +90, +180
